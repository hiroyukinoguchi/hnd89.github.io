        <p>I Joined Origami as an early member of the company when the team was still under 10 people. At that time I lead many e-commerce projects to create an unique marketplace that Origami envisioned. When Origami went though a transition from e-commerce to payment platform, I was one of the core member to work on many of the features from the ground up.</p>

          <p>Discoverying stores</p>
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          At the early phase of Origami pay, the store discovery was an essential feature as the integrated stores were still very limited. We wanted to create an interactive map that users can seamlessly find and learn about the nearest available stores.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          We created a map feature that shows nearby stores, and you could easily swipe through the preview of the stores which pin points on the map as you browse.

          <p>QR code payment</p>
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          For our payment feature, we've had tons of testing to get things right. We wanted to make sure that sensitivity and speed is as fast as possible for our users to have seamless and pleasant experience while they are at the store.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          We were initially focused on ibeacon technology which was a wireless way to make a payment without requiring QR code reader. However, we didn't manage to provide a ideal UX as it was relying heavily on the wifi and network. When the network is poor, people eventually failed to make payments.

        <div class="left">
          Messaging feature was one of the most important feature which enables businesses to communicate with their loyal customers. Customers will receive beneficial updates and news such as time sale and new releases or any other events. You can also recieve digital receipt via message.

        <div class="right">
          After the transition to payment platform, we decided to keep our online marketplace as businesses can benefit from both offline and online to sell their products.
